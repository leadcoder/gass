------------------Build GASS, Windows (MSVC)------------------


1. Dependencies 

	Download dependencies from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ccvd9nfr3ef203g/AACfPrh5gLeGyMDkESLpG3E8a?dl=0
	To build from source see below
	run prepare_build_environment.bat in the new dep folder, this will setup some environment variables used by cmake to find all dependencies

2. GASS

Generate GASS.sln with CMake (after configuring dependencies and GASS)
	Using CMake GUI point "Where is the source code:" to root folder of checked out GASS-folder.
	Point "Where to build the binaries:" to a folder where you want this specific configuration of compiled GASS to end up.
	Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to point to the folder you want the "SDK-version" of GASS to be installed
	When setup, press Configure-button in the GUI.
	If everything went ok, press Generate-button.
	In the source code folder you should now have sln and project files for GASS.

Open GASSSim.sln and build solution
Then build INSTALL-project in the same solution, explicitly. VS will then install the SDK-version of GASS in the folder you specified 
in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

If you want to build dependencies from source you should look for build instructions for each dependency
at it's home location. However, some dependencies are forked or not present elsewhere and they 
are found here: https://github.com/leadcoder/gass-dependencies
The following instructions can be used to replicate the build for the prebuild dependency pack found above,
If version not stated look in prebuild pack to find current version used. 

#--BOOST--
Source can be found here:
http://www.boost.org/
or download prebuilds here: http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=69274
current version used in GASS is 1.59, cmake requirement is 1.46.1

#--TBB--
Both source and prebuilds are found here:
https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/
Note that TBB also is build from forked deps to get a static version of the libs.

#--OGRE---
GASS use v1.9 of OGRE build with OGRE_CONFIG_THREADS=0 (Warning: using background loading in 1.9 will cause ogre terrain component to crash)
and all components, OGRE_BUILD_COMPONENT_OVERLAY etc.
Only OGRE_BUILD_RENDERSYSTEM_D3D9 and OGRE_BUILD_RENDERSYSTEM_GL are tested
Only Boost is tested as threading lib but probably unused due to OGRE_CONFIG_THREADS=0

Source is found here:
https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/src/4578da5bf5b00fdf023b87e98099d647c5cb92ab?at=v1-9-0
Prebuilds deps can be found here: 
http://www.ogre3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=69274

#--FREETYPE---
Free type is needed to build mygui and can be found here as prebuild:
http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/dependencies

#--OSG---
GASS is tested with OSG v3.2 and above
http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/stable-releases/206-openscenegraph-3-4-0-released

Prebuild OSG deps can be downloaded from here
http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/download-section/dependencies

#--FORKED-DEPS---
mkdir gass_dep-src
cd gass_dep-src
git clone https://github.com/leadcoder/gass-dependencies master
cd master
set BOOST_HOME=your boost install dir
set OGRE_HOME=your ogre install dir
set FREETYPE_HOME=your freetype install dir
win-build.bat

#--PHYSX---
https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk
For source you need to request github access at nvidia

#--OPENAL--
Source and prebuilds are found here
http://www.openal.org/downloads

Finally, to get cmake to find all dependencies when generating the gass build
you need to set the environment variables found in the 
prepare_build_env.bat file that is supplied in the gass prebuild dependency pack


------------------Build GASS, Ubuntu------------------


1. Dependencies 

	Download dependencies from: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6lF1bdMT2d2YnUxSThXM3M1Szg&usp=sharing&tid=0B6lF1bdMT2d2U2FjTXZwZ1RuUUE
	Boost is not include in the dep pack, install it->
	sudo-apt-get install boost-dev

2. GASS

Generate Make files with CMake, start cmake gui with the supplied bash file in the dependency folder
	Using CMake GUI point "Where is the source code:" to root folder of checked out GASS-folder.
	Point "Where to build the binaries:" to a folder where you want this specific configuration of compiled GASS to end up.
	Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to point to the folder you want the "SDK-version" of GASS to be installed
	When setup, press Configure-button in the GUI.
	If everything went ok, press Generate-button.

	Go to the build folder and run: make install

If you want to build dependencies from source you should look for build instructions for each dependency
at it's home location. However, some dependencies are forked or not present elsewhere and they 
are found here: https://github.com/leadcoder/gass-dependencies
The following (incomplete) instructions can be used to replicate the build for the prebuild dependency pack found above,
If version not stated look in prebuild pack to find current version used. 

#--TBB---
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev

#--BOOST--
sudo-apt-get install boost-dev

#--OGRE---

sudo-apt-get install ogre?

...or build from source:

#--OSG---
sudo-apt-get install osg?

#--FREETYPE---
? probably installed when osg is installed
