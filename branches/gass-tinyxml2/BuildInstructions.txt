Build GASS

1. Dependencies
Download boost, ogre3d 1.9 SDK and Directx SDK
Create DXSDK_DIR env-var and set it your DirectX SDK installation dir, ie c:\dxsdk\
Create BOOST_HOME env-var and set it  your boost installation dir, ie c:\boost_1.47\
Create OGRE_HOME env-var and set it  your ogre installation dir, ie c:\ogre3d\
Download the latest (if you use the trunk) gass-depdendencies from http://code.google.com/p/gass/downloads/list
Open dependencies.sln in side the dependencies folder and build both release and debug


2. GASS

Generate GASS.sln with cmake (after configuring depedencies and GASS)
	Using CMake GUI point "Where is the source code:" to root folder of checked out GASS-folder.
	Point "Wehre to build the binaries:" to a folder where you want this specific configuration of compiled GASS to end up.
	Set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to point to the folder you want the "SDK-version" of GASS to end up, i.e your dependencies-folder. 
	When setup, press Configure-button in the GUI.
	If everything went ok, press Generate-button.
	In the source code folder you should now have sln and project files for GASS.

Open GASSSim.sln and build solution
Then build INSTALL-project in the same solution, explicitely. VS will then install the SDK-version of GASS in the folder you specified 
in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
